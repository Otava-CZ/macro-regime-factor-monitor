# Macro Regime Factor Monitor

A small .NET 8 ASP.NET Core Blazor app for tracking macro regime factor scores, weekly review notes, and trade idea journal entries.

The app keeps the original weighted scoring idea, but stores factors, indicators, observations, scores, weekly reviews, and trade ideas in SQLite through EF Core.

> Scope note: this is a monitoring and journaling app only. It does not include broker integration or automatic trading.

## Features

- Blazor dashboard showing the latest persisted factor scores.
- EF Core `DbContext` backed by SQLite.
- Seed data for six initial macro factors:
  1. Inflation Pressure
  2. Inflation Breadth
  3. Energy Shock
  4. Growth Stress
  5. Fiscal/Treasury Stress
  6. Market Complacency
- Simple weekly review page.
- Trade idea journal page that preserves entry trigger, invalidation, catalyst, max-loss, time-horizon, post-mortem, and risk-note fields.
- Pressure-aware dashboard interpretation that distinguishes factor score semantics from macro pressure polarity.

## Development environment

This repository includes a Dev Container definition that uses the official .NET 8 SDK image:

```json
"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/dotnet:8.0"
```

Open the repository in the Dev Container so `dotnet` is available for restore, build, and run commands.

## Run on Windows

1. Install the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
2. Open PowerShell in the repository root.
3. Restore and build the solution:

   ```powershell
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the Blazor app:

   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project .\src\MacroRegimeFactorMonitor\MacroRegimeFactorMonitor.csproj
   ```

5. Open the local URL printed by `dotnet run`, such as `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

On first startup, the app creates a local SQLite database file named `macro-regime.db` in the working directory and seeds it with the initial macro factors, one indicator per factor, latest observations, factor scores, a sample weekly review, and a sample trade idea.

## Scoring approach

For each seeded factor, the app computes a normalized raw score from its indicator observation:

```text
raw score = ((value - baseline) / volatility) * direction
weighted score = raw score * factor weight
```

`direction` is `1` when higher values are constructive for risk assets and `-1` when higher values are a macro risk. Weighted scores are summed into category scores and a composite dashboard factor score.

The factor score is not always the same as macro pressure. The dashboard separately runs the latest factor scores through `MacroPressureInterpreter`, which applies an explicit pressure-polarity map:

- Inflation Pressure, Inflation Breadth, Energy Shock, Growth Stress, and Fiscal/Treasury Stress add macro pressure when their weighted factor scores are risk-off.
- Market Complacency is intentionally inverted for pressure interpretation: a low-volatility/complacent market can produce a constructive factor score, but it is treated as market complacency and mispricing pressure.
- Only factors included in the pressure-polarity map are listed as macro pressure contributors, so experimental or future factors do not appear in `ContributingFactors` until they are intentionally mapped.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs a single .NET 8 workflow for pull requests and pushes targeting `develop` or `main`. The workflow restores, builds, and tests `MacroRegimeFactorMonitor.sln` in Release configuration.

## Regime thresholds

| Composite score | Regime |
| ---: | --- |
| `>= 1.5` | Expansion / Risk-On |
| `>= 0.4` | Constructive Growth |
| `<= -1.5` | Contraction / Risk-Off |
| `<= -0.4` | Defensive Slowdown |
| otherwise | Neutral / Transition |
